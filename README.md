# TFM code revision
 
 This jupyter notebook created on Kaggle contains basically the code I have used on my master's degree final project (in Spain known as TFM). 

 Basically it was a bibliographical review of different models in the context of environmental problems, in this case, control of emissions of pollutants.  

 The code is written in R (a known statistical tool developed for statistical analysis). 

  We reproduce and compare some methods from article "Predicting using Box-Jenkins, Nonparametric and Bootstrap Techniques (1995)", García-Jurado, I., González-Manteiga, W., Prada-Sánchez, J.M., Febrero-Bande, M. & Cao, R.  Tech-nometrics, 37, 303-310.
